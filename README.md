## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm returning from a long break from coding with this challenge. Had fun writing and getting back to basics, setting GitHub, using VSCode, creating files and folders in terminal. Writing the HTML was somehow strange since I had forgotten the semantics.

### Continued development

I need to keep writing, taking one day at a time, to prevent getting burned. Keep learning about HTML Semantics and CSS before advancing to JS.
